## Other Skills
During my career I have done various jobs, being a Full Stack Engineer, SDET, QA automation engineer, naturally growing from one area to another, trying to learn and understand as much as I can. At the same time, once I felt I was pretty good at what I was doing, I started to train and help other people. I did job interviews, assessing other people's levels, and if they were accepted to join the company, followed some of them through their career path, giving them work, collecting feedback for them, and helping them to grow.

Also, I did a 3-month course in Java development for a group of 12 people, helping them to become software engineers. 

I can speak 4 languages: English(C1), Belarussian(Native), Russian(Native), Polish(A2)

- I really enjoy watching Sci-Fi movies, especially ones that explore real science ideas and imagine what the world would be like if they were true. Interstellar is the one I like the most.  
- Coding. I love to experiment with new ideas, learn new technologies, and make pet projects. All of them are quite fun to do, for example, here I tried to merge JSON and YAML and created my own SMILE language. Here is a [demo](https://smilelang.netlify.app/). Some of them might be useful, and I learned a lot doing them, for example [formtox.com](https://formtox.com/). I learned how to work with SMTP mail protocol. And [this one](https://fantasy17.pages.dev/) is useless, but beautiful. And [this one](https://webtesting.tools/) is a good collection of useful web development and testing resources. I have many more and I enjoy making them
