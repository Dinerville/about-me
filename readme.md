## Skills
During my career I have done various jobs, being a backend developer, frontend developer, software development engineer in test, QA automation engineer, and full stack engineer, naturally growing from one area to another, trying to learn and understand as much as I can. At the same time, once I felt I was pretty good at what I was doing, I started to train and help other people. I did job interviews, assessing other people's levels, and if they were accepted to join the company, followed some of them through their career path, giving them work, collecting feedback for them, and helping them to grow.

Also, I did a 3-month course in Java development for a group of 12 people, helping them to become software engineers. 

I can speak 4 languages: English(C1), Belarussian(Native), Russian(Native), Polish(A2)

- I love cycling. When I was younger, I decided to use a bike as my main transport to go to school and cycled every day for a couple of years. Now I'm using public transport more, but still love to cycle.
- Coding. I love to experiment with new ideas, learn new technologies, and make pet projects. All of them are quite fun to do, for example, here I tried to merge JSON and YAML and created my own SMILE language. Here is a [demo](https://smilelang.netlify.app/). Some of them might be useful, and I learned a lot doing them, for example [formtox.com](https://formtox.com/). I learned how to work with SMTP mail protocol. And [this one](https://fantasy17.pages.dev/) is useless, but beautiful. I have many more and I enjoy making them
